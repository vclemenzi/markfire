# Markfire

Markfire is a Markdown compiler. This is my first compiler, so expect errors or similar issues.

# Differences from Regular Markdown
One of the main differences in Markfire is that if you move to a new line in the file, the compiler will automatically maintain the text on a new line, unlike many Markdown compilers.

There are also some parameters available to insert at the beginning of the Markdown.
